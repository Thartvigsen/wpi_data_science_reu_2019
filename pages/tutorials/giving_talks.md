## Eugene Freuder on How to Give a Talk

Start with an example! Or counter example.

Meta-message: presenting a talk is a skill that can be studied and practiced. It's worth doing - spend years researching and 10 minutes presenting.. the 10 minutes should be polished.

Main points:
1. Convey Enthusiasm
2. Make it easy to follow
3. Employ examples
4. Be Expressive
5. Enhance your presentation with visuals/dynamic material
6. Engage the audience

### Enthusiasm

If you're not enthusiastic about your work, how do you expect anyone else to be?

Remember the audience is on your side, breathe, drink water.

Tricks:
* Look over their heads
* Turn it into an individual conversation, or a bunch of individual conversations
* Science is fun! So have fun.
* Really hard to be too enthusiastic

### Easy to Follow
Major goal of a talk: get people to read and build on your work. Details are in the paper, the job of the talk is to get people to read it.

KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid

Story from Feynman's lost lecture: Someone asked Feynman to prepare a lecture on some complicated physics concept. Feynman said he would go off and work on it for a few days and come back and give a lecture: "I'll be able to give a freshman-level lecture in a few days!". He came back and said "Okay, I couldn't do it. I couldn't turn it into a freshman-level lecture. *Which means we don't understand it yet*".

Audience doesn't distinguish hard work from the researcher having a hard time explaining it.

Let them see the forest - not the trees.

Explain math/formalisms with visuals and metaphor. Minimize definitions, don't overestimate the audience.

People make talks too difficult by going through material too quickly, or trying to force too much in. Time yourself!

### Use examples
Start with an example, even before the title/introduction. Seems bold but interesting.

Even if you don't start with one - use one. It can be hard to make the example simple enough.

Make example(s):
* Illustrate what you've done
* Simple
* Concrete
* Only add complexity later (or use a running example!)

### Be Expressive
Use your voice and body language to be expressive.

Do:
* Smile
* Listen to yourself beforehand (look for "um"'s, body swaying, etc.)
* Try to make it a conversation, not a declaration)
* Vary your voice (louder/softer, higher/lower)
* Pause occasionally
* Articulate
* Look people in the eye
* Turn off your phone
* Silence computer

Don't:
* Read from a prompt
* Speak in a monotone
* Speak too fast or too slow
* Be distracting (like playing with your hair, rocking back and forth or front to back -> A good alternative is to hang onto the lectern)
* Say "um" or "uh" too much
* mumble
* Fidget
* Turn around and face the screen
* Look at your laptop too much

### Visuals/dynamics
Do:
* Use visuals
* minimize text
* Keep notes for yourself
* remember short term memory of audience (repeat details, highlight big things)
* Pull out what is important

Don't:
*Use bulleted lists

### Engage the audience
How do you engage an audience directly? Ask questions!

Consider why your audience is here: they want to hear what you did. Tell them right away what you're going to do. Big results at the beginning.

Can turn your talk into a story:
* A problem to be solved. Someone came to me in a company with a problem, and so on.
* Could be the "2x2 matrix" story: Folks have done red things and blue things, and folks have done small things and big things, but no one has done big red things!
* Could contradict conventional wisdom
* The "journey" and not just the endpoint

Make the talk fun! Use gimmicks like: playing songs, use props, videos, etc.

Hypothesis: on average, at a CS conference, by the time you reach the halfway point, at least have the people would be tuned out.

If this is close to being correct, think of the waste!
