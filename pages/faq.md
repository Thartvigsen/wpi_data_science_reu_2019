# Frequently Asked Questions

* What are Tom's expectations?
    * Ask questions when you have them and if you're confused about something, **say so right away!**
      * It's a major waste of time not to ask people who may have answers to your questions.
      * Other people have been working on these problems for longer and implementing related algorithms. It will save time to make use of them.
    * Voice your challenges
      * It's supposed to be challenging and is often frustrating.
      * Keep communication open about what's working and what's not working both in research and our communications and strategy.
    * Research often does not pace itself according to the schedule you want so be wary that a consistent 9-5 Monday-Friday schedule often does not fit into the research world.

* What does an average week of summer research look like?
  * We will have **one** meeting per week with faculty advisors (I will be there to help facilitate discussion).
  * You will have **three-four** meetings per week with me, one of which (for now) will be in person on campus. The rest will be over Google Hangouts (twhartvigsen@gmail.com).
  * We will set goals each week and you will present your progress and stumbling-blocks each week.
* How do I install PyTorch?
  * Pray that you are on Linux or Mac, then use Anaconda, their support is pretty good.
  * I will not have initially-good answers for Windows but am happy to work with you to sort it out.
* What should I expect from our weekly meeting with faculty advisors?
  * The advisor-meeting is **extremely valuable!** These folks have knowledge that we need, and it's our job to steer meetings such that we can move forward with the research. Their job is to ensure that we are making progress and to push us by asking challenging questions and helping us figure out the weaknesses in our work along with weaknesses in our understanding of technical topics. Without tough questions, it's hard to know whether or not you actually understand a topic!
  * Every week you should **prepare a couple of slides showing graphics of what you have done and what your challenges are**. E.g. a graph showing some results or a flowchart of your currently-implemented model so that they can quickly understand what you have done so that they can help us improve and take the next steps. The quicker everyone understands your status, the less time we spend focusing on a confusing figure instead of getting the help we need! Also, it generally isn't productive to show blocks of code in the slides, there are Ph.D. students in the lab who can help when you have coding questions.
  * These meetings tend to be rather results-driven, showing off your findings and why we trust them. **It is extremely beneficial to figure out what feedback you want before going into the meeting**. I can help figure out what feedback you need from them.
  * Each week, you should prepare a brief project-status slide at the beginning of your slides and a brief next-steps slide at the end.
* What should we expect from our meetings with Tom?
  * I expect less than the faculty members in terms of visual clarity in slides and am perfectly happy to discuss code if that is your stumbling block.
  * The structure of our more frequent meetings will be 1. What have you done since we last met? 2. Where are you stuck and how can we fix it? (this may involve me sitting with you right then and there and getting past some bug) 3. What would you like to show in the next meeting and how do you plan to get there?
  * I am fairly laid back and easily impressed but I do want to have a constant and complete understanding of exactly what you are working on so that we can ensure movement in productive directions.
  * In general, I am happy to discuss mainly stumbling-blocks as opposed to current findings (i.e., less results-driven), I think that we can all greatly benefit by emphasizing what we have learned each week and how that ties into our overall project goals.
